## Current Limitations

### 🚨 QTI Integration Gaps

#### 1. Question Creation UI - Limited QTI Support
**Current Issue:** Manual question creation only supports legacy types
```javascript
// QuestionManager.jsx currently handles only legacy types:
case 'single_answer':      # Legacy type
case 'multiple_answer':    # Legacy type  
case 'matching':          # Legacy type
// ❌ Missing: All 24 QTI type creation forms
```

**Impact:** Admins cannot manually create new QTI question types through UI

#### 2. Question Preview System - Partial QTI Coverage
**Current Issue:** Preview system doesn't recognize all QTI types
```javascript
// getQuestionPreview() function missing QTI type cases:
function getQuestionPreview(question) {
  switch (question.type) {
    // Only legacy types handled
    // ❌ Missing: 24 QTI type preview handlers
    default:
      return 'Question';  # Fallback for unknown types
  }
}
```

**Impact:** QTI questions show generic "Question" preview instead of descriptive text

#### 3. Question Editing - Limited Support
**Current Issue:** Editing interface not updated for QTI question payloads
**Impact:** Cannot edit QTI questions after AI import

### ⚠️ UI/UX Limitations

#### 1. Manual QTI Creation
- **Missing:** Form interfaces for 24 QTI question types
- **Current:** Only AI import pathway for QTI questions
- **Needed:** Manual creation forms for each QTI type

#### 2. Visual Consistency
- **Issue:** QTI questions may not match admin UI design patterns
- **Needed:** Consistent preview styling for all question types

**Solution Needed:** 24 question type creation forms

#### 2. Question Preview System (Medium Priority)  
**Issue:** QTI questions show generic preview
**Solution Needed:** QTI-aware preview function

#### 3. Question Editing (Medium Priority)
**Issue:** Cannot edit QTI questions after import
**Solution Needed:** Edit forms for QTI question types

---

## Recommendations for Phase 2

### 🎯 Priority Actions

#### 1. Extend Manual Question Creation (Phase 2)
```javascript
// Add QTI question type forms to QuestionManager.jsx
case 'fill_in_the_gaps':
  return <FillInTheGapsForm question={question} onChange={updateQuestion} />;
case 'identifying_information_true_false_not_given':
  return <TrueFalseNotGivenForm question={question} onChange={updateQuestion} />;
// ... for all 24 QTI types
```

#### 2. Enhance Question Preview (Phase 2)  
```javascript
// Update getQuestionPreview() for QTI types
case 'fill_in_the_gaps':
  return `Fill in the gaps: ${question.payload.prompt.substring(0, 50)}...`;
case 'identifying_information_true_false_not_given':
  return `TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN: ${question.payload.prompt.substring(0, 50)}...`;
// ... for all 24 QTI types
```

#### 3. Add QTI Question Editing (Phase 3)
- Create edit forms for each QTI question type
- Update validation for QTI question payloads  
- Add QTI-specific field editors

---

## Summary

### ✅ Admin UI Strengths
- **Complete AI Import Pipeline:** Perfect for bulk QTI question creation
- **Advanced Test Management:** Full lifecycle control for all test types
- **Sophisticated Grading:** Interactive scoring works with QTI questions
- **Student Management:** Complete oversight and analytics
- **Professional UI:** Well-designed, responsive admin interface

### 🔧 Areas for Enhancement
- **Manual QTI Creation:** Need forms for 24 question types
- **Question Preview:** Better previews for QTI questions
- **Edit Capabilities:** QTI question editing interface

### 📊 Overall Assessment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⚪ (4/5 - Excellent with Room for Manual Creation)

**Current Status:** The admin UI is production-ready for AI import workflow but needs manual creation forms for complete QTI support.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Phase 2 (AI templates) while planning manual creation forms for Phase 5 (Frontend Integration enhancement).
