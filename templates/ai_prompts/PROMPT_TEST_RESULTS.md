## Test Case 1: TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN (Reading)

### Input to DeepSeek

**Using:** MASTER_PROMPT.md

**IELTS Question Text:**
```
Reading Passage 1

Climate Change and Agriculture

A
Climate change is having a profound effect on agricultural practices worldwide. 
Farmers are experiencing shifts in growing seasons, with spring arriving earlier 
in many regions. This has led to changes in planting schedules and crop selection.

B
Research conducted in 2018 showed that temperature increases of just 2 degrees 
Celsius could reduce crop yields by up to 20% in some areas. Scientists warn 
that without adaptation strategies, food security could be threatened.

C
Many governments have introduced incentive programs to help farmers adopt 
climate-resilient practices. These include drought-resistant crop varieties 
and improved irrigation systems.

Questions 1-4

Do the following statements agree with the information in Reading Passage 1?

Write:
TRUE if the statement agrees with the information
FALSE if the statement contradicts the information
NOT GIVEN if there is no information on this

1. Climate change is affecting farming practices globally.
2. Spring is arriving later due to climate change.
3. A 2-degree temperature rise could decrease crop yields significantly.
4. All farmers have adopted climate-resilient practices.

Answers: 1. TRUE  2. FALSE  3. TRUE  4. NOT GIVEN
```
